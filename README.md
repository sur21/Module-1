# Assignment Instructions
The idea of this assignment is to create a front-end application that presents the user with a textbox where they can list comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered, the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button.

If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message should show up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!" should show up under the textbox.

If the textbox is empty and the user clicks the "Check If Too Much" button, the message "Please enter data first" should show up. 'Empty' here means either "" (empty string) or a string with just spaces in it. (Hint: AngularJS ng-model already performs the trimming for you, so there shouldn't be anything you need to do.)

Only 1 message should be shown at any given time. In other words, if you have both messages "Enjoy!" and "Too much!" showing up at the same time, it's an error.

You are not required to handle a case where there is no item between some commas. For example, you are free to consider this case item 1, item2,,item3 or this case item 1, item2, ,item3 as 4 items in the list. However, you can implement checking for an 'empty' item as a bonus feature (ungraded). Please make sure to put a comment somewhere next to the input textbox stating that you do NOT consider and empty item, i.e., , , as an item towards to the count.
